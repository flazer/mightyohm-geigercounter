## Introduction
Years ago i bought a geiger counter kit at [chaos communication congress](https://events.ccc.de/).
Time flew by and i forgot about it. A few month ago I found it in one of my “one day i'll do the project”-crates.
Now, after some weeks of tinkering while streaming this live at [https://www.twitch.tv/chrisfigge](https://www.twitch.tv/chrisfigge), i've done it and added some improvements.
I've removed the batteryholder, because I want to use the kit stationary and replaced it with a Wemos D1 mini.
Therefore I'm able to connect the geiger counter to my Home Assistant + I added a small OLED Display, to see all data directly when standing in front of it (+ 10 coolness).
After the electronics where finished, I've designed an enclosure, based on the one from DerKurt.
Thanks for your awesome work!
I've added the possibility to add an OLED display and two buttons, so you're able to switch the menus and disabling the ticking sound.

## Assembly
To assemble the 3d printed parts. You will need some glue, to glue the inlay parts.
Because I'm not very good in get parts in correct position, I've printed a centering guide.
Just place the guide onto the platform and glue the "hill" nearly perfectly centered onto the baseplate. Remove the guide afterwards.
